	<p>I'm a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in my last semester. 
	I'm pursuing a double major in English and Economics as well as taking 
	coursework for a certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. 
	I have strong interests in research, technical writing, and policy/data analysis.</p>

	<p>When I'm not in class, I like to dedicate my free time to my extracurricular leadership 
	roles on campus. I was president of the Adopted Student Advisory Panel during the fall 
	semester of 2018 and their treasurer during the fall semester of 2019. 
	The Adopted Student Advisory Panel is a registered student organization that 
	advocates for adoptees and adoptee families and works to build a safe and accepting 
	community. As an adoptee, I was compelled to become involved in this student organization
 	when I transferred to UMass. Being their president and working with my peers and Rudd Adoption 
 	Research taught me the importance of community, team building, and public outreach.</p>
